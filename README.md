##### Future Improvements:
1. By using Bootstrap, I want to learn more other technics and design built in bootstrap. It's a great framework because it gives me the ability to create a website like this portfolio fast and responsiveness. 

2. And also I want to enhance my design skill. To build a great design for any web app, I created. Like this portfolio. I want to try other design that has a more animation or to integrate interactive site.

3. By learning and creating web application. I also want to try other frameworks, that gives the ability to write less. And do more with the pre-built code.
